This motif is characteristic of the HPC-for-Quantum integration approach. It emphasizes leveraging loosely and medium-coupled task parallelism to optimize quantum circuit execution by utilizing multiple processing elements (PEs), both classical and quantum. For instance, this is essential in tasks like sampling and estimating expectation values. Another use case involves parameterized circuits, where the same circuit is executed with varying parameters. Distributing such tasks across different PEs can significantly improve estimation accuracy. Similarly, parallelism can be employed by partitioning different terms of a Hamiltonian across multiple PEs.

Various abstraction layers and tools support this parallelism. For example, Qiskit Aer offers multiprocessing and Dask executors at the backend device level, while Qiskit Serverless provides middleware-level support.

The Quantum Simulation mini-app implements the circuit execution motif by utilizing the Qiskit library to generate random quantum circuits. These circuits are executed on different Aer simulator backends, including configurations with and without GPU support. To manage tasks across multiple nodes, the mini-app leverages a distributed Dask cluster environment orchestrated by the mini-app framework.
